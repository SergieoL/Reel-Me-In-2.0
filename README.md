### What is App for? <a name="what"></a>
Reel-Me-In was developed to allow the user to post comments about movies and decide if the movie was worth paying $10.50 a ticket to see in cinemas. It allows users, once logged in, to post movie reviews. Other users may comment on those reviews agreeing or disagreeing. This gives the reader a full picture of how the public feels about the movie. If the user is not logged in, they may still see the reviews but cannot post or comment. Reel-Me-In-2.0 was created using:
* Node.js
* Express
* Mongodb
* Mongoose
* React
* Bootstrap
* GraphQL
